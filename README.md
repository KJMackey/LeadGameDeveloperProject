# LeadGameDeveloperProject

## Project description

The overall goal is for the user to be able to press buttons randomly using the InputData scene. This data requires security (i.e. encrypted in transmission and at rest). In other words, you cannot store this information in a plain txt but can remain in RAM. Once the user has pressed the buttons, they can see their results in the StatsDisplay scene. Here, the user can clear their data and/or return to the InputData scene to add more data. 

### Requirements:
- Accurately collect user inputs from the buttons.
- Manage user data between scenes securely.
- Display the user's button pressing "progress" in some way besides just text.

### Notes:
- You can use any free asset you want.
- You can add to the README to justify any design decisions you made.
- Feel free to ask me questions if you have them. Our team will typically work like this, just message me whenever you need.
- You can tear apart/redo the scenes, they're just placeholders for clarity of project requirements. 

### Dev Notes:
-I added a bit more than just the basic requirements to display more working knowledge
-I used a serialized saved file to store the information to keep it simplistic but still have some security on the file.
